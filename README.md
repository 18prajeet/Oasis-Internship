## 🔢 Task 2 – Number Guessing Game

A console-based game where the system generates a random number, and the user tries to guess it. The program gives hints ("Too high" / "Too low") and counts the number of attempts.

### ✅ Features:
- Random number generation within a predefined range.
- User input and validation.
- Hint after every wrong guess.
- Attempt tracking.
- Option to play again.
